# CSS Modules
1. Never use bare HTML element selectors (like div, pre, code) in CSS Modules files.
2. Always use a local class name for selectors (starting with a dot).
3. For styling HTML elements, create a specific class name that describes its purpose (e.g., .preBlock instead of pre).
4. Nested selectors must include at least one local class name (e.g., .bookInfo h2 is valid because it includes .bookInfo).
5. When targeting elements inside a component, prefer creating new class names over nesting selectors.
